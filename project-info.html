    <h2>Project Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      This project aims to support learners who are struggling with understanding Electromagnetism (E&M), a subject that is often considered abstract, mathematically intense, and difficult to visualize. Through this website, I hope to make E&M concepts more approachable and engaging for fellow students.
    </p>

    <p>
      I understand from personal experience how challenging E&M can be, especially when trying to form clear mental models of electric fields, magnetic forces, and their interactions. That’s why this site includes both text explanations and interactive tools like the Coulomb force calculator—to help users actively explore and internalize these key principles.
    </p>

    <p>
      Building this website also gave me a valuable opportunity to revisit and apply my coding skills. It is the first full website I have ever created, and I’m genuinely proud of the result. Throughout the process, I not only deepened my understanding of physics, but also improved my ability to communicate complex ideas through a multimodal platform.
    </p>

    <p>
      Overall, this project reflects both my academic interests and personal growth, and I hope it can serve as a useful resource for others studying Electromagnetism.

    <h2>Author’s Reflection</h2>

    <p>
      Creating this website has been one of the most personally meaningful and creatively challenging projects I’ve done in college so far. My goal from the beginning was to build a space where learners struggling with electromagnetism—a notoriously difficult topic in physics—could find explanations, interactive tools, and encouragement to keep going. Electromagnetism is not only abstract, but also mathematically heavy, and I remember how lost I felt when I first encountered the concepts. This site is my way of reaching back to help those just starting their journey.
    </p>

    <p>
      This project allowed me to bring together different skills: writing clearly, organizing information, and coding functional and visually appealing webpages. It was the first time I built a complete website on my own, including buttons, layout, calculators, and a working message board with likes and replies. Each feature, from the toggleable Welcome Letter to the Coulomb Calculator, was not just for show—I designed it with user experience and learning in mind.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through this process, I became more confident not only in my technical abilities, but also in my voice as a communicator. I had to think carefully about tone, audience, accessibility, and multimodal composition. I learned that clear visuals, interactive elements, and a calm, inviting tone are just as important as the content itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      If there’s one thing I’ve taken away from this project, it’s that learning isn’t just about consuming information—it’s about engaging with it, sharing it, and making it your own. That’s what I tried to do here, and I hope this site will continue to be useful to others beyond the classroom.
