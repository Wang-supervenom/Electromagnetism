    This project aims to support learners who are struggling with understanding Electromagnetism (E&M), a subject that is often considered abstract, mathematically intense, and difficult to visualize. Through this website, I hope to make E&M concepts more approachable and engaging for fellow students.
</p>

<p>
    I understand from personal experience how challenging E&M can be, especially when trying to form clear mental models of electric fields, magnetic forces, and their interactions. That’s why this site includes both text explanations and interactive tools like the Coulomb force calculator—to help users actively explore and internalize these key principles.
</p>

<p>
    Building this website also gave me a valuable opportunity to revisit and apply my coding skills. It is the first full website I have ever created, and I’m genuinely proud of the result. Throughout the process, I not only deepened my understanding of physics, but also improved my ability to communicate complex ideas through a multimodal platform.
</p>

<p>
    Overall, this project reflects both my academic interests and personal growth, and I hope it can serve as a useful resource for others studying Electromagnetism.
